# Super Employee

This app was made for me learning using jQuery and Laravel.

## Installation

1. Prepare `.env` file by copying `.env.example` in root folder
2. Run `php artisan key:generate` to generate key for your Laravel app.
3. Change configuration of database to your needs (host, username, database name, password).
4. Create database in your server according to your `.env` file.
5. Run `php artisan migrate` to generate necessary tables.
6. Run `php artisan db:seed` to generate necessary data and employee dummy data.
7. Test this app!
